# Git @ FoodX
## Standard tool
Git is a tool which enables text-based collaboration. We all need to communicate rapidly and be part of our common FoodX voice.

## Why
Public and private forms of communication; that enable us to collaborate. An easy example is [ethics @ FoodX](https://github.com/Food-X-Technologies/ethics). This is meant to be public, so that people joining our company can more fully understand who we are. This is meant to allow for anyone in our company [and outside] to make edits and build a better future.

## Hacking
The importance of git is that we are all able to take action; without fear of losing history.

## Learning

Ask a peer to help you with anything as you get started. You can create a git repo, on your computer to learn on, and no one else will see if [safe learning].
